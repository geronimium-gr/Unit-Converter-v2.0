                        <h2 class="title">What is Time?</h2>
                        <p> 
                            <strong>Time</strong> is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in an apparently irreversible 
                            succession from the past, through the present, into the future. Time is a component quantity of various 
                            measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, 
                            and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. 
                            Time is often referred to as a <strong>fourth dimension</strong>, along with three spatial dimensions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The operational definition of <strong>time</strong> does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. 
                            It does not address why events can happen forward and backwards in space, whereas events only happen 
                            in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between <strong>space and time</strong> led 
                            physicists to define the spacetime continuum. General Relativity is the primary framework for 
                            understanding how spacetime works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental 
                            investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted, particularly 
                            at the edges of black holes.

                                An Egyptian device that dates to c. 1500 BC, similar in shape to a bent T-square, 
                                measured the passage of time from the shadow cast by its crossbar on a nonlinear rule. 
                                The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At noon, the device was turned around so 
                                that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.
                            </p> <br>
                            <p>
                                A <b>sundial</b> uses a <b>gnomon</b> to cast a shadow on a set of markings calibrated to the hour. 
                                The position of the shadow marks the hour in local time. The idea to separate the day 
                                into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials, which operated 
                                on a duodecimal system. The importance of the number 12 is due to the number of lunar 
                                cycles in a year and the number of stars used to count the passage of night.

                                The most precise timekeeping device of the ancient world was the <b>water clock</b>, or <i>clepsydra</i>, 
                                one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh <i>Amenhotep I</i>. They could be used to 
                                measure the hours even at night, but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. 
                                The Ancient Greeks and the people from Chaldea (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained 
                                timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. 
                                Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of 
                                water clocks up to the Middle Ages. In the 11th century, Chinese inventors and engineers 
                                invented the first <b>mechanical clocks</b> driven by an escapement mechanism.

                                An <b>hourglass</b> (or sandglass, sand timer, sand clock or egg timer) is a device used to measure 
                                the passage of time. It comprises two glass bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that 
                                allows a regulated flow of a substance (historically sand) from the upper bulb to the lower 
                                one. Typically the upper and lower bulbs are symmetric so that the hourglass will measure 
                                the same duration regardless of orientation. The specific duration of time a given hourglass 
                                measures is determined by factors including the quantity and coarseness of the particulate 
                                matter, the bulb size, and the neck width.

                                The English word <b>clock</b> probably comes from the Middle Dutch word <i>klocke</i> which, in turn, 
                                derives from the medieval Latin word <i>clocca</i>, which ultimately derives from Celtic and is 
                                cognate with French, Latin, and German words that mean bell. The passage of the hours at 
                                sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see ship's bell). The hours were marked 
                                by bells in abbeys as well as at sea.

                                An <b>atomic clock</b> is a clock device that uses a hyperfine transition frequency in the microwave, 
                                or electron transition frequency in the optical or ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic 
                                spectrum of atoms as a frequency standard for its timekeeping element. Atomic clocks are 
                                the most accurate time and frequency standards known, and are used as primary standards 
                                for international time distribution services, to control the wave frequency of television 
                                broadcasts, and in global navigation satellite systems such as GPS.

                        <p>
                            A <strong>unit of time</strong> or midst unit is any particular time interval, used as a standard way of measuring or 
                            expressing duration. The base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI) and by extension 
                            most of the Western world, is the <strong>second</strong>, defined as about 9 billion oscillations of the caesium atom. 
                            The exact modern definition, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology is:
                            <br>

                                    The duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.
