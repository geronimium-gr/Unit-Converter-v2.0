                        <h2 class="title">What is Weight?</h2>
                        <p> 
                            In science and engineering, the <strong>weight</strong> of an object is the force acting on the object due to gravity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some standard textbooks define weight as a <strong>vector</strong> quantity, the gravitational force acting on the object.
                            Others define weight as a <strong>scalar</strong> quantity, the magnitude of the gravitational force. Yet others define it as
                            the <strong>magnitude</strong> of the reaction force exerted on a body by mechanisms that counteract the effects of gravity: the weight
                            is the quantity that is measured by, for example, a spring scale. Thus, in a state of free fall, the weight would be
                            zero. In this sense of weight, terrestrial objects can be weightless: ignoring air resistance, the famous apple falling
                            from the tree, on its way to meet the ground near Isaac Newton, would be weightless.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The unit of measurement for weight is that of <strong>force</strong>, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the <strong>newton</strong>. For
                            example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about
                            one-sixth as much on the Moon. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often
                            confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and
                            vice versa).

                        <p>
                            Discussion of the concepts of <strong>heaviness</strong> (weight) and <strong>lightness</strong> (levity) date back to the ancient <strong>Greek philosophers</strong>.
                            These were typically viewed as inherent properties of objects. <strong>Plato</strong> described weight as the natural tendency of objects
                            to seek their kin. To Aristotle, weight and levity represented the tendency to restore the natural order of the basic
                            elements: air, earth, fire and water. He ascribed absolute weight to earth and absolute levity to fire. <strong>Archimedes</strong> saw
                            weight as a quality opposed to buoyancy, with the conflict between the two determining if an object sinks or floats. The
                            first operational definition of weight was given by <strong>Euclid</strong>, who defined weight as: "the heaviness or lightness of one
                            thing, compared to another, as measured by a balance."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to <strong>Aristotle</strong>, weight was the direct cause of the falling motion of an object, the speed of the falling object
                            was supposed to be directly proportionate to the weight of the object. As medieval scholars discovered that in practice
                            the speed of a falling object increased with time, this prompted a change to the concept of weight to maintain this
                            cause-effect relationship.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Weight</strong> is commonly measured using one of two methods. A <strong>spring scale</strong> or hydraulic or <strong>pneumatic scale</strong> measures local
                            weight, the local force of gravity on the object (strictly apparent weight force). Since the local force of gravity can
                            vary by up to 0.5% at different locations, spring scales will measure slightly different weights for the same object
                            (the same mass) at different locations. To standardize weights, scales are always calibrated to read the weight an
                            object would have at a nominal standard gravity of 9.80665 m/s2 (approx. 32.174 ft/s2). However, this calibration is
                            done at the factory. When the scale is moved to another location on Earth, the force of gravity will be different,
                            causing a slight error. So to be highly accurate and legal for commerce, spring scales must be re-calibrated at the
                            location at which they will be used.
